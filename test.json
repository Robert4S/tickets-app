      Try to figure out the owners name from this email address, and come up with a mean roast, incorporating their name. Make it feel personal, even if this means completely making up information about the person.
      Make the roast very concise, maximum 15 words, and only use bigoted teenager humor. Make the roast feel like you know them,
      but speak about the person in the third person, not the second person. Only use the persons first name, even if their last name is visible
      from the email address. Make the roast as painful as possible. Do not use any other information from their email address
      other than their first name. If the persons name sounds russian, write the response in russian cyrilic and make it very offensive."}
